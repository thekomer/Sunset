#### Depreciation notice:

Due to the lack of resources, this repo is deprecated.
I will rebuild this theme later on with different base because - in my opinion - one of current base sources do not comply with GPL guidelines.
'Till then, fill free to use it on old-stable linux releases. It works just fine for me on debian 11.

# Sunset GTK theme

![](art/Sunset-1080.png)

Sunset is a dark orange-accented Gtk3 & Gtk4 theme based on [Sweet theme](https://github.com/EliverLara/Sweet) by EliverLara and [Mint-Y-Dark](https://github.com/linuxmint/mint-themes) by Linux Mint development team. It is mostly created for my personal use but also shared for anyone that might like it.

#### Installation:

Download latest release file and extract the zip file to the themes directory i.e. `/usr/share/themes/` for system-wide use; or to `~/.themes/` (create it if necessary) for single user. Then change theme via distribution specific tool.
